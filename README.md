# Linear Regression Exercises

## Description

This is an exercise using linear regression to evaluate trends in different data sets.
Data sets include:
 - Factors influencing used car resale price
 - Biological data on crickets' response to temperature data.
 - Biological data on species' body weight to brain weight ratio (riddled with erroneous data! Yay!).
 - Salary discrepancies between men and women used in a sex discrimination lawsuit.

The analysis uses ipython notebooks and scikit-learn.


## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Use scikit-learn to perform linear regression
* Understand single-variable and multiple-variable linear regression

## Details

### Deliverables

* A Git repo called linear-regression containing at least:
  * a `requirements.txt` file
  * a set of IPython notebooks

## Normal Mode

Go through the IPython notebooks included with this repository and complete
all exercises in them. Some exercises will be marked as Hard Mode.
